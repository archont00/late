## Testing is essential

Garimin's framework is extremely buggy, fragmented and unreliable as hell with tight memory limits. A framework bug can appear on any device independently even if it works perfectly on a different one. 

Memory limits are the biggest struggle at this point because the text of calendar events takes up a lot of memory. Even slight additions without optimizing memory elsewhere is not viable anymore. If you dare to submit an improvement (as only the bravest ones did) run [integrationTests.sh](https://github.com/myneur/late/blob/master/bin/integrationTests.sh) according to the instructions there. It automatically tests and screenshots selected scenarios in selected devices (on Mac OS).
