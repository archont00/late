lineHeight = height + 2
base = height of '0' char id=48 because of Garmin bug: https://forums.garmin.com/developer/connect-iq/i/bug-reports/fr645-and-others-since-fw-7-20-major-issues-with-custom-fonts
 - prevously I used base = lineheight * 0.9
yoffset -= min(yoffset+1)
xoffset of '1' reduced by 1/3
xadvance of '1' reduced by 2x reducement of xoffset
